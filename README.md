Using Historical Maritime Vessel Records to Predict the Weather

For centuries, the crews of ocean-going vessels have maintained essential records onboard known as logbooks. Typically, one of the officers enters a "noon report" each day at noon local time. This entry includes vital information such as the ship's position, course, speed, weather and ocean current conditions, and any special remarks.

Using historical data obtained from maritime vessel logbooks, I will build a model that predicts weather patterns via a Neural Network.
