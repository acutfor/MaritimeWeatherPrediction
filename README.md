Using Historical Maritime Vessel Records to Predict the Weather

For centuries, the crews of ocean-going vessels have maintained essential records onboard known as logbooks. Typically, one of the officers enters a "noon report" each day at noon local time. This entry includes vital information such as the ship's position, course, speed, weather and ocean current conditions, and any special remarks.

Using historical data obtained from maritime vessel logbooks, I built a model that predicts weather patterns via a Neural Network.

To create my model, I will used data from the Climatological Database for the World's Oceans. This data contains over 280,000 noon reports from 1750-1850. Further information can be found at the following link: http://webs.ucm.es/info/cliwoc/

Indeed, as weather science and technology has greatly changed since 1750-1850, the accuracy of the data is not as accurate as it would be today. In this case, it is important to note that the 'Data' in Data Science does not always lead to a perfect science - but we can still use it to gain insights on overall trends and patterns.
